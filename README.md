# Discord-LLM
Runs a LLM using the API from https://www.neuroengine.ai/. Includes a comprehensive UI with slash commands for character profiles, properties, etc, to make the bot easily usable.
This is not very actively maintained, so you might have to change the presets in the top and bottom of model.py as the models on Neuroengine update. 
Besides that, make sure it has manage webhook permissions.
Also, be aware that user data is lost if you turn off the bot. This isn't too serious, as users should be able to copy their character profile by scrolling up to where they made the character, but it can be a bit of a nusiance.
